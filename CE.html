                    <p><br>is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture.<br> <br>

Usual tasks involving computer engineers include writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers, designing VLSI chips, designing analog sensors, designing mixed signal circuit boards, and designing operating systems. Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motors, communications, and sensors.<br><br>>

In many institutions of higher learning, computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree. Other institutions may require engineering students to complete one or two years of general engineering before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus.</p>

                <div class="content"> <center><b> ADVANTAGES    </b></center> 
                    <br><p>1. Salary: Computer engineers enjoy salaries two and a half times the national average salary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) the average salary of a computer hardware engineer is $117,220 per year or $56.36 per hour. Computer engineers in computer and peripheral equipment manufacturing earn $140,840 which is the highest average salary.<br> <br>
2. Demand: Another advantage of computer engineering careers is that, according to the BLS, there is a demand across the country, giving computer engineers the flexibility to work almost anywhere.<br> <br>
3. Competitive analysis: The ability to manage and manipulate a large amount of data is a competitive edge in itself. Furthermore, budgeting, planning, and forecasting is an incredibly powerful way to stay ahead of the competition, goes way beyond standard analysis, and is also easy to perform with BI software. Businesses can also track their competitor’s sales and marketing performance and learn how to differentiate products and services.<br><br>
4. Innovation & Creativity: Computer engineers work towards creating better and more optimized versions of existing products. They must account for technological advancements as well as trends to create innovative solutions, which can be very exciting for professionals who like to stay up to date and enjoy problem solving.</p> <br> <br> </div>

                <br><p>
1. Big Data Engineer
Big Data Engineers are responsible for building, testing, and maintaining scalable Big Data ecosystems for the businesses so that the Data Scientists can run their algorithms on stable and optimized data systems. Big Data Engineers usually work closely with Data Architects, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists, all focused on one goal – to help organizations obtain meaningful insights from large and complex datasets that can be transformed into actionable business decisions. Big data is one of the best career options after computer engineering.<br> 

As the name suggests, Big Data Engineers work primarily with Big Data ecosystems, tools, and technologies. They are required to upgrade, troubleshoot, and optimize Big Data systems and software to improve the efficiency of the databases. Usually, Big Data Engineers need a few years of industry experience in working with Big Data frameworks like Hadoop, SQL-based databases, and also with popular data APIs and ETL tools. <br><br>

                    2. Machine Learning Engineer
 Machine Learning Engineers are sophisticated ML experts who specialize in designing and building intelligent machines and systems that can learn from experience and perform human-like tasks with minimal or no human supervision. They create advanced ML algorithms that can teach computers how to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed for the same. Also, Machine Learning Engineers develop state-of-the-art ML and Deep Learning systems and run various ML tests and experiments to innovate unique AI-powered machines. <br> <br>
