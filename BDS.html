                <div class="content"> <center><b> ADVANTAGES    </b></center> 
                    <br><p>1. Restore the oral health and transform the lives of their patients.<br>
Whether it is providing preventative care, delivering dental restorative procedures, eliminating pain or correcting dento-facial esthetics, often, in a single visit, the dentist can experience the satisfaction, privilege and joy of positively transforming a patientâ€™s life by restoring oral health.<br><br>

2. Be independent in their careers.<br>
Dentists have the opportunity to own their own businesses right after dental school. This gives them a lot of independence and allows them to set their own business and career goals.<br> <br> 

3. Earn a good salary.<br>
In 2018, the average net income for an independent private general practitioner who owned all or part of his or her practice was $190,440 and $330,180 for dental specialists, according to the ADA Health Policy Institute 2018 Survey of Dental Practice. Incomes vary across the country and depend on the type of practice. <br> <br>

4. Choose from a number of career options.<br>
While 80% of dental school graduates go into private practice in general dentistry, the profession offers a wide range of clinical, research and academic opportunities to both new graduates and dentists at any stage of their careers.

                <br><p>1. Shape the future of oral health care.<br>
In addition to clinical practice, the dentist can also contribute significantly to the future direction of oral health care by engaging in dental education and research. Dental educators have the ability to shape the dental school curriculum and the professional role of the dentist by establishing themselves as faculty members in dental education. As a dental researcher, the dentist uses the most advanced techniques and technologies and applies cutting-edge scientific findings to advance the profession forward by discovering new oral health phenomenon or seeking a resolution to a myriad of oral health issues.<br> <br>

2. Exercise creativity in their daily work.<br>
Dentistry is often referred to as an art. It requires mastery and technique unique to the profession. Dentistry is largely based on maintaining proper oral health, but is also an aesthetically focused practice. A large part of dentistry involves restoring teeth and making a smile beautiful, one that the patient is happy to show to others. <br> <br>


3. Provide benevolent care to their communities.
With an annual income well above the national norm, combined with a flexible work schedule, the dentist is allowed the privilege and ability to provide oral health care to those communities and populations that desperately lack access and affordability.
